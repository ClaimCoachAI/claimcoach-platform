Exterior Trim
- Paint fascia: 150 LF @ $3.00 = $450.00
- Paint exhaust vents: 2 EA @ $25.00 = $50.00

Subtotal: $14,450.00
Overhead & Profit (20%): $2,890.00

```

**Review:**

- Note any missing items

**Actions:**

### Step 4: Upload Carrier Estimate

When you receive the insurance company's estimate PDF:

1. Click "Upload Carrier Estimate"
2. Select the PDF file (max 10MB)
3. Click "Upload"
4. System parses PDF automatically (takes 1-2 minutes)

**What Happens:**

1. PDF is uploaded to secure storage
2. System extracts text from PDF
3. AI structures the data into line items
4. You're notified when parsing is complete

**If Parsing Fails:**

- Check PDF is text-based (not scanned image)
- Try re-uploading
- Contact support if issue persists

### Step 5: Compare Estimates

Once both estimates are ready:

1. Click "Compare Estimates"
2. System analyzes line-by-line differences (takes 30-45 seconds)
3. Review the comparison report

**What You'll See:**

```
Estimate Comparison

Summary:
- Industry Standard Total: $17,340.00
- Carrier Estimate Total: $14,650.00
- Difference: $2,690.00

Discrepancies Found: 2

1. Install new asphalt shingles
   Industry: $9,000.00 (2000 SF @ $4.50)
   Carrier: $7,000.00 (2000 SF @ $3.50)
   Difference: $2,000.00

   Justification: Carrier used outdated pricing. Current market
   rate for architectural shingles in Austin is $4.50/SF installed,
   per NRCA 2026 pricing guide.

2. Paint fascia
   Industry: $450.00 (150 LF @ $3.00)
   Carrier: $300.00 (150 LF @ $2.00)
   Difference: $150.00

   Justification: Carrier underestimated labor. Standard rate
   for exterior trim painting is $3.00/LF per local contractor
   surveys.
```

**Review:**

- Verify discrepancies are legitimate
- Check justifications are strong
- Note any items carrier omitted entirely

### Step 6: Generate Rebuttal Letter

When you're ready to challenge the carrier estimate:

1. Click "Generate Rebuttal Letter"
2. System creates professional business letter (takes 20-30 seconds)
3. Review the letter

**Sample Letter:**

```
February 6, 2026

To: Insurance Adjuster
[Carrier Name]

Re: Claim Review Request - Claim Number ABC123
Property Address: 123 Main Street, Austin, TX 78701
Policy Number: POL-123456

Dear Adjuster,

I am writing to request a reconsideration of the carrier estimate
provided for the property damage claim referenced above.

After careful review of the carrier estimate against current
industry-standard pricing for the Austin, TX market, we have
identified significant discrepancies that warrant discussion.

DISCREPANCIES IDENTIFIED:

1. Install new asphalt shingles
   Carrier Estimate: $7,000.00
   Industry Standard: $9,000.00
   Difference: $2,000.00

   The carrier estimate appears to use outdated pricing for
   architectural asphalt shingles. Current market rate for this
   material and installation in the Austin area is $4.50 per
   square foot, as documented in the National Roofing Contractors
   Association (NRCA) 2026 pricing guide...

[Full letter continues]

We respectfully request a meeting to discuss these discrepancies
and review the supporting documentation. We believe that adjusting
the estimate to reflect current market pricing is fair and
appropriate for all parties involved.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to
working with you to resolve this matter promptly.

Sincerely,

[Property Manager Name]
[Contact Information]
